# Minimal

I'm working on finding assymmetric minimal surfaces. The current program is to create the numerical software needed to implement various ideas in evolving surfaces (implicit and explicit) toward minimal surfaces. In addition, setting up the infrastructure to visualize what is going on for debugging, verification, and understanding.
